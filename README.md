# Note

The optimized diameter calculation methods used in this research is now available by [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl)'s `diameter()` function directly, from V1.13.2.

This research supported by the [William H. Neukom 1964 Institute for Computational Science](https://neukom.dartmouth.edu/).

As of Feb 2026, the codes will not be updated until the research paper is fully ready. Expected finish of the paper is late March 2026.

During March, the finalized, clean codes will be uploaded.
